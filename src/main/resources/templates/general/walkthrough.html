                        You can earn investment returns in two ways: growing the value of your portfolio, or earning
                        income
                        through dividends. Growth stocks are the ones that you want to buy low and sell high, although
                        you
                        can't guarantee that result. Income stocks generally have more predictable returns, but you
                        won't
                        get any big jumps in the stock's value.</p>

                        Also, think about when you might need to convert your stock holdings into cash.
                        The more time you have, the more aggressive you can be with your stock picks.</p>

                        Diversifying your investments among different companies and industries will spread out your
                        exposure, so that no single stock can wipe out your savings.</p>

                        Buying stocks strategically can take an incredible amount of research.
                        If you aren't sure where to begin, start with companies and industries you already know.
                        Make it a habit to read investors' newsletters and the daily financial news.
